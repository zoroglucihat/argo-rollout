## 3.3 Use Cases
-----

<b>Feature Releases and Upgrades</b>: One of the primary use cases of Argo Rollouts with a blue-green strategy is when you are releasing a new version of your application or a significant feature upgrade. You can use the blue-green deployment strategy to switch users to the new version without any downtime. In the event of an issue with the new version, you can quickly switch back to the old version, ensuring continuous service availability.

<b>Bug Fixes and Patch Releases</b>: Sometimes, you might need to release a quick bug fix or a security patch. Using Argo Rollouts, you can spin up the patched version of your application (green environment) alongside the current version (blue environment). Once you have validated the patched version, you can switch the user traffic to the green environment.

<b>A/B</b> Testing: While this is typically associated with canary deployments, you can also use a blue-green strategy for specific A/B testing scenarios. For example, if you want to test a major change in your application, you can use Argo Rollouts to deploy the new version to a small segment of users. You can then gather feedback and usage data before deciding whether to roll it out to all users.

<b>Infrastructure Changes</b>: If you are planning to make significant changes to your infrastructure (like changing the database schema or migrating to a different type of server), a blue-green deployment can help. You can set up the new infrastructure and deploy your application on it (green environment) while keeping the current infrastructure and application running (blue environment). You can then switch over to the new infrastructure once you are confident that it is stable and performs as expected.
