### Section 5

# Demo

Let's kick off our demo session with a basic introduction to Argo Rollouts. This powerful tool is designed to help you manage deployments in Kubernetes with advanced strategies like Blue-Green and Canary.

For this demo, we're going to simulate a typical workflow. We'll start by writing and committing code, pushing it to our Git repository, and then watching as Argo Rollouts automatically manages the deployment for us.
